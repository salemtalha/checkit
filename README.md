checkit
=======

my waterloo hackathon project earlier this year. the idea is pretty simple, you send links to your friends and they can log in and look at them when they have time, as opposed to sending them links in a fb chat where they'll likely miss it and not get back to it. this is a scratch to an itch i have personally day to day. if it becomes mature enough maybe it'll be of use to someone else
